# Know Your Enemy

We're all talking about the coronavirus these days, but how much do you know about other diseases and the pathogens that cause them? Know Your Enemy is a card memory that gives you the opportunity to test that!

Your goal is to match the name of the pathogen with the appropriate fact. This is not only a test of how much you know about diseases, but also a test of your memory.


This game is currently under construction, but will be built with React and Redux.
